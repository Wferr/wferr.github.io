##Emotions
Well I know that this is all new and such and that I should try to keep it "Clean", "On Topic" etc. But its a needed thing right now. As some people may know if they have had experinces with emotions is that you have no controll over them once you have them. Im no expert in anything really, So take whatever i say with the smallest grain of salt you can. (No really.. Please do.)

###Venting
>So back to venting. So this month has been a rollercoaster for me. Emotions all on the floor. And what is the first thing I do? Break down, go insaine. Make **everyone** think im crazy. Loose the one who I love. Well as im not truely sure on what happend, wish me luck when I try again. But back to the point. This post and whole blog thing isnt just for to help me vent but to help others also. If you know me in real live im a pretty private person about stuff like relationships and etc. So this is going a bit out of my confront zone to share this on the open web like so. 

####Relaxing
>One of the main way I vent is by just going on the computer. I derp around reddit, imgur, forums. Till I find something intresting. Like for example how I found [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). So for the last 5 or so hours as I have been thinking about things running through my head I have been putting them in code. Trying new things, learning new things, just doing what I enjoy doing; Codeing. (Fun fact, im not, erm how to say this.. *good* at any programming languages. Because really HTML, Bash, and other things like that dont count.)

#####Music
>Music? [Yeah Buddy!](http://team254.com/store/yeahbuddy/) Most of time I end up listing to some super **super** chill step. For the last two hours I have been shuffling through [Holy Other](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7txCfGfh46OwoUBDPj4HKL) on Spotify. The constant just heavy but chilling bass and the lack of vocals and a fast beat really at least for me is super relaxing. 
Related to the music is this song [Ghouls - Tha New Team Remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/4lV3dZCapT3CSrKFpPlAQX) Just so relatable to how I feel currently. But to up beat and *loud* for me right now. Chill step or however people would classify Holy Other as. 

Well that comes to the end of my writing time. Ill see you another day interwebs. 

If anyone would like to chat or **anything** else feel free to send me and email. It makes me the happyest person alive when I recive a email thats not automatically sent. hello@wferr.com
