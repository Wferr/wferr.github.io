>“To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson

So currently that is my favorite quote **ever** it just is so true to this current world and what is all happening around us now days.
How everyone is trying thier best to convince you that thier idea is the *best*. That kinda stuff is the most annoying to me.
Everyone has the ability to make up thier own mind and thier own belives and to stick with them. And for fairness I have been that person that is set on thier opinion and tries to sway other people. But logicall arguments are fine but when you get in the zone of illogical arguments it just starts being nonsenes. 

As for that quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson what is means to me is more than just you having your opinions. Its how you act, dress (admitly I dress pretty normal), and talk to people. Just being your self is the best thing you can do all the time. Trying to put a cover on how you really are is one of the things I have done and I can say from first hand experiance that its useless to do. People will love you for who you are. No need to put a cover on and deal with having to keep a "alter-ego" up.
